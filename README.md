This is a customized Python tool built for a specific purpose. As the name suggests, it is a “RAG-like” utility that sits between a full-fledged RAG system and a purely manual search.

The tool is intended for students who want to refresh and deepen their understanding by revisiting past questions from earlier tests. It enables semantic search over a question bank, allowing users to retrieve similar questions one at a time while working on new ones.

I felt the need for this tool during my academic journey over the past few months while studying AI and ML in a structured manner through certification courses. As part of this process, I regularly took weekly tests using ChatGPT, consisting of MCQs, conceptual questions, and scenario-based problems.

Over time, I began noticing subtle variations and deeper probing of the same core concepts across different test papers. Revisiting these semantically similar questions turned each weekly test into a richer learning experience. Probing the evaluation logic of LLMs and challenging their feedback also added a valuable meta-learning layer.

While it was easy to manage without accumulated memory initially, after 8–10 weeks I realized the opportunity to systematically revisit past questions, attempt them with greater precision, and improve answer quality.

I personally observed two advantages from using this approach. First, understanding any concept is a spiral process — insights deepen as we return to similar topics periodically. Second, as knowledge genuinely expands, dependence on the question bank naturally reduces.

This self-help tool has been extremely useful for me. However, it works best when its purpose is clearly understood and when it is used with discipline — only as a support mechanism, not a crutch.

Sharing with delight.
