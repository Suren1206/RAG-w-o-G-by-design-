This is a customized python block to support on a specific purpose ; As the title suggests, this is “RAG-like” tool which can be positioned in between a true RAG and performing a manual search.

This is meant to support students who want to keep their memory refreshed from the past questions that they have taken up retrieved from a question bank of previous tests with a semantic search of current questions – one at a time. 

I felt a need for this tool during my academic pursuit for past few months. I have been studying AI and ML topics  in a systematic manner taking up series of certification courses. As a part of learning, I also had started taking tests from Chat GPT on weekly basis which consists a combination of  MCQ as well as conceptual questions and questions involving practical scenario.

By using a dedicated thread for taking up such tests & evaluation, I started noticing - with interest -  the mild variations and deeper level of similar concepts tested in subsequent question papers making each weekly tests as an enriching experience. All such LLMs also give meta level feedback when we probe their evaluation and challenge their reviews which is even more useful.

While it was quite easy to take up the initial tests without accumulated memory - after crossing 8 to 10 weeks – I started realizing that it is an opportunity to review the semantically similar questions of the past and attempt the questions with better quality and precision.

After all, any test is taken up only to deepen our understanding and not to test our superficial memory particularly when we are serious and sincere.
Two distinct advantages which I realized personally  by using this tool
(1) Understanding any concept is more a spiral process where we get more insight as we circle back to similar topics in a systematic manner periodically
(2) The number of instances when we refer back to the Question Bank comes down in lot more cases as the knowledge really deepens by expansion of our “known” territory.

This self help tool is extremely useful for me – but to use this one needs to understand its purpose and requires self discipline to use it diligently only when needed.

Sharing with delight.
